The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Whups Ticket
Tracking System version H5 (3.0.11).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking software development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status. For more
information on Whups, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/whups.

The major changes compared to the Whups version H5 (3.0.10) are:
    * Fixed open redirects.
    * Small bugfixes.
