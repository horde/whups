The Horde Team is pleased to announce the third release candidate of the Whups
Ticket Tracking System version H5 (3.0.0).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking software development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status. For more
information on Whups, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/whups.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/whups/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/whups/docs/INSTALL

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Whups version H5 (3.0.0RC2) are:
    * Move attachments list to separate ticket tab.
    * Hide citings in comments by default.
    * Small bugfixes.
