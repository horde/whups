The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Whups
Ticket Tracking System version H3 (1.0-RC2).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking sofware development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Whups H3 (1.0).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
New and updated translations would also be great.

Major changes compared to the Whups H3 (1.0-RC1) version are:
    * Added date search criteria.
    * Implemented editing for query elements.
    * Allow to save searches as queries.
    * Added feeds for searches and queries.
